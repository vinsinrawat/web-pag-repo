<H1>About Us</H1>

<P>Add a file or directory to Git CM control. This does not commit the files to the repository but merely adds files to "staging" status.
Must also perform: git commit to enter changes in the repository.
View staged files: git ls-files --stage
Empty directories are not added. Git manages files only.
--update: stage all tracked and modified files.
